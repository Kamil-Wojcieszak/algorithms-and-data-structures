# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++. Here's an overview of the implemented data structures:

## Table
- **Description:** Table is implemented using dynamic array.
- **Features:**
    - Load data from file.
    - Add, remove, and search elements.
    - Generate random table.
    - Save table to file.
- **Usage:**
    - Run `menu_table()` to interact with table functionalities.

## List
- **Description:** List is implemented using doubly linked list.
- **Features:**
    - Load data from file.
    - Add, remove, and search elements.
    - Generate random list.
    - Save list to file.
- **Usage:**
    - Run `menu_list()` to interact with list functionalities.

## Tree (Red-Black)
- **Description:** Red-Black Tree implementation.
- **Features:**
    - Load data from file.
    - Insert, delete, and search nodes.
    - Generate random tree.
- **Usage:**
    - Run `menu_tree()` to interact with Red-Black Tree functionalities.

## Heap
- **Description:** Binary Heap implementation.
- **Features:**
    - Load data from file.
    - Add, remove, and search elements.
    - Generate random heap.
- **Usage:**
    - Run `menu_heap()` to interact with Heap functionalities.

## How to Use
- Each data structure has its own menu function (`menu_table()`, `menu_list()`, `menu_tree()`, `menu_heap()`).
- Compile and run the program.
- Choose the desired data structure from the menu and follow the instructions to perform operations.

## Running Tests
- Tests for each data structure can be run by selecting the corresponding option from the menu.
- Ensure all functionalities are working correctly by running tests.
